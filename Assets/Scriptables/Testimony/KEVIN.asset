  testimony: 'Kevin: It all started when I was in bed and I heard something downstairs.

    Kevin:
    I''m scared of being alone, so I wake up very easily.

    Kevin: After I heard
    a noise, I went down to check.

    Kevin: By the time I came downstairs, the
    delicious cookies that mum had baked were completely gone!

    Kevin: The milk
    was not there too! It was as if someone had drank all our milk!

    Krampus:
    And what is the evidence that proves this was Mr.Claus?

    Kevin: After that,
    I went to look at our, uh, chimney.

    Kevin: And I saw footsteps!

    Kevin:
    They were big and covered in dirt.

    Kevin: After that, I went to my room
    and hid! I was so scared.

    Kevin: By the time my parents woke up, I told
    them and they called the police.

    Krampus: The crime photographer at the
    scene took pictures of these footsteps.

    Krampus: The size of the footprints
    match the size and boot model of Mr.Claus. There are not many people with this
    foot size.'
