  testimony: 'Rose: This morning, one of Mr.Claus''s reindeers showed up at our doorstep
    at aroud 10:00 this morning.

    Rose: It appeared to be lost and shook.

    Rose:
    We took the kind animal in and ran many tests on it.

    Rose: Our tests revealed
    that the animal was severely malnourished!

    Rose: The poor reindeer had been
    eating poorly for so many years!

    Rose: It was also visibly exhausted and
    dehydrated.

    Rose: I suspect it didn''t have any water the entire day!

    Rose:
    These reindeer are looked after by Santa, right? How could he treat them in such
    a way!'
