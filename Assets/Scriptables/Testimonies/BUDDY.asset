  testimony: 'Buddy: It was a fog-enveloped night.

    Buddy: Snow was falling lightly
    upon the hardened cement outside our lodging.

    Buddy: When the slience of
    the evening was suddenly pierced by a shrieking cry!

    Buddy: I woke in fright
    and rushed to the attend to the reindeers.

    Buddy: Alas, I have grown all
    too comfortable with their painful cries.

    Buddy: Banging was coming from
    the shed as I slowly approached it.

    Buddy: When the wooden doors burst open
    from the inside!

    Buddy: Prancer dashed by my side, knocking me away.

    Buddy:
    I chased after him all night and morning.

    Buddy: But to no avail.

    Buddy:
    By the time I had gotten back, the other elves had already reported this.'
