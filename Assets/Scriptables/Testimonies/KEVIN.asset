  testimony: 'Kevin: After dinner, we laid out milk and cookies and went to bed.

    Kevin:
    Just before midnight, I heard a noise! So I went down to check.

    Kevin: By
    the time I came downstairs, the delicious double butter triple chocolate chip
    cookies that we laid out were completely gone!

    Kevin: The milk was not there
    too! It was as if someone had drank all our milk!

    Krampus: And what is the
    evidence that proves this was Mr.Claus?

    Kevin: After that, I went to look
    at our, uh, chimney.

    Kevin: And I saw footsteps!

    Kevin: They were big
    and covered in dirt.

    Kevin: After that, I went to my room and hid! I was
    so scared.

    Kevin: By the time my parents woke up, I told them and they called
    the police.

    Krampus: The size of the footprints match the size and boot
    model of Mr.Claus.'
