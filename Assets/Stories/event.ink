Santa wakes up to a commotion.
One of the reindeers in his entourage has been reported as missing.
The elves responsible explain they were locked in their stable that night.
The lock appeared to be broken from brute force.
Santa's morning attendance from the elves show that one elf was not present.
The trial continues.
